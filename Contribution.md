+ Detect errors and wrong decision of each algorithm:
  + Activities:
    + Set the depth of algorithm to 4 (or any number you want) and the number of movements per second to 5
    + Watch the game to find out the bad decision (for example, the highest tile is often located at the conner and suddenly leave that place)
    + Detect the `bad cases`, which lead to all the bad decision above

## About Statistics:
+ Collect the highest tile after each game and show them with diagram (graph):
  + Activities:
    + Get the data from 500 to 1000 games and calculate the rate of achieving each tile
